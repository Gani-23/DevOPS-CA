# Automated Infrastructure Management with Kubernetes and Terraform

## Problem Statement:
Managing infrastructure manually is error-prone and time-consuming, especially in dynamic environments where scalability and flexibility are required. Automating infrastructure management ensures consistency, repeatability, and faster provisioning.

## Project Goals:
- **Automate** the provisioning and management of cloud infrastructure using Terraform.
- **Implement Kubernetes** for container orchestration and manage the entire lifecycle of applications.
- **Ensure** the infrastructure is self-healing, scalable, and aligned with the principles of Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

## Tools Used:
- **Terraform** for IaC
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration
- **Helm** for Kubernetes package management
- **AWS, Azure, GCP** for cloud infrastructure
- **Ansible** for configuration management
- **Prometheus** for monitoring and alerting
