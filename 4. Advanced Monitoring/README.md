# Advanced Monitoring and Alerting System using Prometheus and Grafana in Microservices Architecture

## Problem Statement

Microservices architectures introduce complexity in monitoring and alerting due to the distributed nature of services. Traditional monitoring tools are often inadequate for providing the necessary visibility and responsiveness.

## Project Goals

- **Set up a monitoring and alerting system** tailored for microservices architectures.
- **Implement custom metrics collection** for key performance indicators (KPIs) of microservices.
- **Design a dashboard** to visualize system health and performance metrics.
- **Create alerting rules** to detect anomalies and potential issues in real-time.
- **Send notifications** over Slack or Telegram.

## Tools Used

- **Prometheus** for metrics collection and alerting.
- **Grafana** for data visualization and dashboards.
- **Kubernetes** for microservices orchestration.
- **Loki** for log aggregation.
- **Alertmanager** for handling alerts from Prometheus.
- **Jaeger** for distributed tracing.
- **Slack** for notification.


## Steps to reproduce 

- **Step1** Dockerise MERN Application, Create service, deployment, namespace etc
- **Step2** Helm, Grafana, Promethus and loki 
- **Step3**
- **Step4**
