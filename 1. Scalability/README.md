# Scalable CI/CD Pipeline Implementation for Multi-Cloud Environments

## Problem Statement:
Organizations are increasingly adopting multi-cloud strategies to avoid vendor lock-in, improve resilience, and leverage the best services from different cloud providers. However, implementing a scalable CI/CD pipeline across multiple cloud platforms presents challenges in terms of consistency, security, and performance.

## Project Goals:
- **Design and implement** a CI/CD pipeline that can deploy applications to multiple cloud environments (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) while maintaining consistency.
- **Ensure secure and efficient handling** of credentials and secrets across cloud platforms.
- **Optimize pipeline performance** to minimize deployment times and reduce operational overhead.

## Tools Used:
- **Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or CircleCI** for pipeline orchestration
- **Terraform or Pulumi** for infrastructure as code (IaC)
- **Kubernetes** for container orchestration
- **HashiCorp Vault** for secrets management
- **Docker** for containerization
- **AWS, Azure, GCP** for cloud environments
- **Prometheus and Grafana** for monitoring
